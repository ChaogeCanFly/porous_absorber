# Microperforated Panel

A microperforated absorber does not require a porous absorber layer because energy losses are achieved using the viscous boundary layer within the perforations.  In order for this device type to be effective, the perforations must be sub-millimetre in diameter.

The advantage of this device type is that it can be constructed from clear materials such as perspex or glass.

A microperforated panel of thickness ***t<sub>p</sub>*** with circular holes of radius ***a*** at a spacing ***D*** is mounted above a cavity whose total depth is ***d***.
